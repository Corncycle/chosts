cohost! is an online platform that allows users to make posts containing HTML markup with inline css (with restrictions)

This repository contains the source code and raw HTML for my gimmick posts on cohost.org

I make these either in Python with the xml.etree API, or in Javascript with webpack and npm as a task runner.
